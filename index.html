        <h4 id="objectives">Objectives of the game</h4>
        <p>
          The objective of blackjack is simple: each player faces the dealer
          individually, aiming to
          <b
            >achieve 21 points or the closest possible number without exceeding
            it</b
          >. To attain this, each player receives two cards at the beginning.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b
            >If the initial two cards add up to 21, it's the best possible play
            and is called Blackjack</b
          >.When players don't reach 21, they can request additional cards to
          get closer, but if they exceed 21, they automatically lose.
        </p>
        <p>
          The dealer, who is also part of the game, follows specific house rules
          in blackjack. They receive two cards, and their options are
          straightforward:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            If they have
            <b>16 or less, they are obligated to request another card</b>.
          </li>
          <li>If they have <b> 17 or more, they must stand</b>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <b>The dealer beats all players who exceed 21</b> and those with a
          hand of lesser value than theirs. For instance, if the dealer has 19
          points, they win against all players with 18 or less and 22 or more
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>They lose to players with a higher hand</b> and to those who have
          stood if the dealer exceeds 21 points. A tie in blackjack occurs
          between the dealer and players with the same point total.

        <h4 id="values">Card values in Blackjack</h4>
        <p>
          In blackjack, cards have their own values. If we want to play better
          each time and reach our 21 points, we must know by heart the value
          assigned to each card in the deck.
        </p>
        <p>The value of the cards in blackjack are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>The Ace is the only card with two values, 1 and 11</b>. The
            player with the Ace can choose its value as needed.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b
              >Cards form 1 to 10 are valued according to ther numerical
              order.</b
            >
          </li>
          <li><b>The Jack, Queen, and King share a value of 10 points.</b></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Now you now, as every good blackjack 21 player should, that in a deck
          of 52 cards,there are 16 cards worth 10 points.

        <h4 id="turns">How to play Blackjack: truns and mechanics</h4>
        <h5>Table and dealer</h5>
        <p>
          Blackjack is played on a semicircular or half-moon-shaped table. The
          dealer is located on the straight side of the table, while the players
          are on the curved side. The dealer oversees the game, signals the
          moments, deals and collects cards, and manages the payout bets. They
          are also responsible for playing on behalf of the bank.
        </p>
        <h5>Betting Round</h5>
        <p>
          <b>The first step in blackjack is the betting round</b>. Each player
          seated at the table places their bet in their playing area, and there
          is a predeterminated minimum and maximum limit for each bet. The
          dealer, representign the bank, does not bet and plays against each
          player for the same amount they have wagered.
        </p>
        <h5>Dealing of cards</h5>
        <p>
          Once the bets are placed, the blackjack hands begins.
          <b
            >The dealer deals two cards to each participant, staarting with the
            player to their left and proceeiding clockwise, one card at the
            time</b
          >. Are these cards are face-up, revealing their value, except for one
          of the dealer's cards, of which only one is visible.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the dealer's face-up card is an Ace, it gives players the option to
          insure. This allows participants to bet that the dealer will have
          Blackjack, potentially recovering a portion of their original bet.
          Why? Because
          <b
            >there are 16 cards worth 10 points, increasing the likelihood of
            Blackjack considerably with an Ace</b
          >, which can be valued at 1 or 11.
        </p>
        <h5>Blackjack Turns</h5>
        <p>
          Once the cards are dealt, the player to the left of the dealer begins
          and has several possible options in their quest to win the blackjack
          game:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Split</b>: if the cards have the same value, the player can split
            them to have two hands. A seccond hand will be added to each split
            card, but in this version of blackjack, it means the player can no
            longer request additional cards.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Hit</b>: to achieve blackjack or get as close as possible, the
            player can request as many cards they want. If they go over 21,
            their cards will be removed, and the bet is fortfeited.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Stand</b>: whether after receiving the first two cards or after
            hitting, the blackjack player has the option to stand and wait for
            the end of the round.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Double Down</b>: this option allows the player to double the
            original bet in exchange for receiving one more card. Afterward,
            their turn is closed, awaitin the round's conclusion.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Dealer's turn</b>: when the players' rounds end, the dealer wins
            if there are no active players left. If there are remaining bets,
            the dealer must reveal their cards. If they have 16 or less, they
            are required to request another card. If they have 17 or more, they
            are obligated to stand.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4 id="prizes">Prize destribution</h4>
        <p>
          When the dealer's hand concludes, the prizes are distributed. Each
          hand that beats the dealer's is paid 1 to 1, meaning the player
          receives the same amount they bet. If it's a Blackjack, the payout is
          3 to 2. If a Blackjack is achieved after doubling down, the payout is
          1 to 1.
        </p>
        <p>
          In cases where there are insured players, if the dealer ends up with
          Blackjack, they will pay 2 to 1 to the insured players. After the
          prize distribution, the hand is considered concluded, and a new
          betting round begins.
